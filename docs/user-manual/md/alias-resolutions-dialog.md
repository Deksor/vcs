# Alias resolutions dialog

This dialog can be accessed with <menu-path>Context > Input > Dialogs > Aliases...</menu-path>.

With the alias resolutions dialog, you can instruct VCS to automatically override certain capture resolutions.

For instance, if you find that your capture device is displaying 640 &times; 400 as 512 &times; 488 (or something to that effect), you can define 640 &times; 400 as an alias of 512 &times; 488. Whenever the capture device reports a new video mode of 512 &times; 488, VCS will tell the device to use 640 &times; 400, instead.
