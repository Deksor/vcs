# Getting started

Assuming you've installed the driver for your capture device, as well as unpacked the binary distribution of VCS (linked to, above) into a folder, getting VCS going is simply a matter of running its *vcs.exe* executable.

When you run the executable, two windows will open: a console window, in which notifications about VCS's status will appear during operation; and the output window, in which captured frames are displayed.

    You can use VCS's <a href="#command-line-options">command-line options</a> to automate
    start-up tasks.

If this is your first time running VCS, the first thing you may want to do is adjust the capture video parameters (phase, position, colors, etc.). They can be set up via the [video presets](#video-presets-dialog) dialog.
